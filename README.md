# **HippoCurl - A Modular HTTP & Networking Utility** ü¶õüåê

HippoCurl (`hc`) is a **powerful, modular command-line utility** designed for **HTTP requests, network diagnostics, and security analysis**. It provides an **extensible framework** where users can run various **modules** to perform **API requests, DNS lookups, port scanning, geolocation analysis, and more**.

## **Key Features**
‚úÖ **Modular Architecture** ‚Äì Easily extendable with custom modules  
‚úÖ **HTTP & API Interaction** ‚Äì Send requests, inspect responses, and analyze APIs  
‚úÖ **Networking Tools** ‚Äì DNS record lookup, reverse DNS, IP geolocation, Whois  
‚úÖ **Security Insights** ‚Äì Open port scanning, SSL/TLS certificate analysis  
‚úÖ **AI-Enhanced** ‚Äì API response summarization, anomaly detection, intelligent suggestions  
‚úÖ **CLI-Friendly** ‚Äì Supports structured output, formatted tables, and spinners for better UX  

## üöß Under Construction üöß

HippoCurl is currently **under development**! ‚öôÔ∏è  
We are actively building new features, improving performance, and expanding its capabilities.  

Stay tuned for updates! üöÄ  

In the meantime, feel free to explore the existing modules and contribute to the project.
