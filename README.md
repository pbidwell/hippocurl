# **HippoCurl - A Modular HTTP & Networking Utility** ü¶õüåê

HippoCurl (`hc`) is a **powerful, modular command-line utility** designed for **HTTP requests, network diagnostics, and security analysis**. It provides an **extensible framework** where users can run various **modules** to perform **API requests, DNS lookups, port scanning, geolocation analysis, and more**.

## **Key Features**
‚úÖ **Modular Architecture** ‚Äì Easily extendable with custom modules  
‚úÖ **HTTP & API Interaction** ‚Äì Send requests, inspect responses, and analyze APIs  
‚úÖ **Networking Tools** ‚Äì DNS record lookup, reverse DNS, IP geolocation, Whois  
‚úÖ **Security Insights** ‚Äì Open port scanning, SSL/TLS certificate analysis  
‚úÖ **AI-Enhanced** ‚Äì API response summarization, anomaly detection, intelligent suggestions  
‚úÖ **CLI-Friendly** ‚Äì Supports structured output, formatted tables, and spinners for better UX  

## üöß Under Construction üöß

HippoCurl is currently **under development**! ‚öôÔ∏è  
We are actively building new features, improving performance, and expanding its capabilities.  

Stay tuned for updates! üöÄ  

In the meantime, feel free to explore the existing modules and contribute to the project.  

## Usage

HippoCurl (`hc`) is a command-line tool designed to simplify HTTP requests, API interactions, and service explorations.

### Basic Command Structure

```
hc <module> [arguments]
```

- `<module>`: The name of the module you wish to execute (e.g., `api`, `explore`, `log`).
- `[arguments]`: Optional parameters that vary by module.

### API Requests

To make an API request using a configured service:

```
hc api <service> <route> <environment>
```

If any of the parameters are omitted, HippoCurl will interactively prompt you to select the desired service, route, and environment.

Example:

```
hc api UserService GetUser Development
```

This will:
- Fetch the `GetUser` route from the `UserService` in the `Development` environment.
- Use the configured base URL, headers, and authentication.
- Display the response in a structured format.

### Exploring Hosts

```
hc explore <hostname or IP>
```

Example:

```
hc explore example.com
```

This will:
- Resolve DNS records.
- Retrieve IP-based geolocation.
- Perform common port scans.
- Detect SSL/TLS certificate details.

### Viewing Logs

```
hc log
```

This command displays:
- The location of the log file.
- The last 100 lines of logs.

### Configuration

HippoCurl uses a YAML-based configuration to define services, environments, routes, and authentication details. See the `hc_config.yml` file for customization.

```
~/.hcconfig/hc_config.yml
```

Modify this file to add new API services, routes, authentication methods, and custom headers.
